### Infrastructure locations

Google Cloudâ€™s infrastructure is based in five major geographic locations: North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Having multiple service locations is important because choosing where to locate applications affects qualities like availability, durability, and latency, which measures the time a packet of information takes to travel from its source to its destination.

**Geographic locations contain regions and zones**
